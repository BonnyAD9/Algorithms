# Algorithms
Interesting and useful algorithms implemented in C

## Exp
**TCO** stands for **Tail Call Optimization**. This means that it is
possible for the compiler to avoid Stack Overflow by optimizing
recursive code.

**Depth** stands for **Recursion Depth**. This is not specified if the
algorithm has TCO.
